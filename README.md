# asciinema-rec_script
Uses metaprogramming to augment shell scripts and pass them to asciinema rec --command

## Motivation

The [asciinema](https://asciinema.org) tool is an awesome terminal session recorder.

And it has a [rec [filename]](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema#rec-filename) command with a `-c --command=<command>` option.
This specifies a `command` to record (other than the default of `$SHELL`)

So given an (executable) script `demo-date_maths`:
```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
## Date maths

# The `date` command can be used to retrieve the:
#  * *day of the week* using the `%l` option
day_of_the_week=$(date +%l)

#  * *hour of the day* using the `%u` option
hour=$(date +%u)


# Now, can you guess what we're going to do with those two numbers?
# ðŸ¤”...
sleep 3

# We're going to add them together!
echo $((day_of_the_week + hour))
day_of_the_week=$(date +%l)
hour=$(date +%u)
echo $((day_of_the_week + hour))
```

We can use asciinema's `rec` to make a recording:
```
asciinema rec --command screencasts/demo-date_maths
```


And that recording is going to lose a bunch of context and end up something like this:
```
12
```

If, however we instead used this command:
```
asciinema-rec_script screencasts/demo-date_maths
```

Without *any* effort we can end up with a recording like this:

## Getting Started
### Installation:
Place `asciinema-rec_script` somewhere in your $PATH.


#### Requirements:
 * [asciinema](https://asciinema.org) ([installation](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema#installation))
 * bash
 * (optional) [bat](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat) ([installation](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat#installation)) # A cat clone to provide syntax highlighting


### Example Usages:
 * `asciinema-rec_script ./screencasts/demo-date_maths`     # No additional arguments will pass `asciinema rec` a filename of `./screencasts/demo-date_maths.cast` to place the recording in
 * `./screencasts/demo-date_maths.asc`                      # Will take advantage of the shebang line `#!/usr/bin/env asciinema-rec_script` in the `.asc` script
 * `./screencasts/demo-date_maths.asc --`                   # Allows `asciinema rec` to receive no additional arguments (eg. `--` for no arguments, which will allow it to maintain its default behaviour of uploading to https://asciinema.org)
 * `SLEEP=0 ./screencasts/demo-bash_functions.asc`          # Will pass any necessary env vars to the script
 * `source ./screencasts/demo-date_maths.asc`               # Will source the .asc script in your $SHELL (which should be ~roughly~ compatible with bash)

(Nb. the `.asc` extension ("ASCiinema") is not strictly necessary, but gives some uniformity.)


### How it works
`asciinema-rec_script` (written in bash) reads from the file passed to it one line at a time and will detect:
 * _lines of code_
 * _comments_
 * _blank lines_
 * and some other _special lines_

It uses meta-programming to build an augmented version of itself from each of these lines storing them in a temporary `augmented_script` file.

And finally it passes that file (and any other arguments specified on the command line) to `asciinema run --command <augmented_script>` for it to make a recording.
