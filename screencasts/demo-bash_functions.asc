 f1


sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
# Next we'll change `f1` to accept "arguments"
# Unfortunately bash functions don't have named arguments,
# they just use positional parameters `$1`, `$2` etc
# 
# So we're going to assign them to variables.
# ie. like function "arguments" in other languages...

# 👎 Fail!
# That's no good, the `$a` & `$b` env vars we set previously have changed!

# 🏆 Success!
# No global env vars were harmed in the making or calling of this function.

# Now, give the "arguments" default values using `${name:-default}` syntax

sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
# Now, what about defaulting to the values of env vars outside the function?
# ie. with this syntax:  `a=${1:-$a}`

# And how bout falling back to our original default values?
# ie. with this syntax:  `a=${1:-${a:-a 2}}`
source "${script%.asc}/f1.5"

# Now, let's get even funkier with `$c` and get its default from a function.
# And just cause we can, let's call *it's* function `c`
c() { date; }

sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
# ie. which just prints the date
c


sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
# So now change `c=...` in `f1` to make use of our `$(c)` function...
source "${script%.asc}/f1.6"

 f1   'a 1'


sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
# Now let's mix things up a bit and call `f1` in a different way.
# We can call it in context of new values for `$b` & `$c`,
# by placing them in front of the call to `f1`.

# 🤔 ... but won't that change the global values for `$b` & `$c`?

# Let's check:
sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
:;echo "BEFORE: a='$a', b='$b', c='$c'"
c='c 3' b='b 3'   f1   'a 1'
:;echo "AFTER : a='$a', b='$b', c='$c'"


sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
# 🏆 Success!
# Once again...
# No global env vars were harmed in the making or calling of this function.


sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
# Hmm... now here's one more trick, but IMO it's more trouble than it's worth.
# This trick involves passing in var assignments as "arguments" to the
# function, for `local` to evaluate.
# *Then* we can default back to original values with a *second* `local`.


sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
# That magic function (which we'll call `f2` for short) looks like this:
source "${script%.asc}/f2"


# And it can be called like this...
sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
 f2  a='a 4' b='b 4'


# Or this...
sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
a='a 4'  f2  b='b 4'


# Or this...
sleep ${SLEEP:-5}
a='a 4'  f2  c='c 4' b='b 4'
