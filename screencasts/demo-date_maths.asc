## Date maths

# The `date` command can be used to retrieve the:
#  * *day of the week* using the `%l` option
day_of_the_week=$(date +%l)

#  * *hour of the day* using the `%u` option
hour=$(date +%u)


# Now, can you guess what we're going to do with those two numbers?
# ðŸ¤”...
sleep 3

# We're going to add them together!
echo $((day_of_the_week + hour))
