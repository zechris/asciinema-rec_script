# Contributing to asciinema

First, if you're opening a Github issue make sure it goes to the correct repository:

* [asciinema/asciinema](https://github.com/asciinema/asciinema/issues) - command-line recorder
* [asciinema/asciinema-rec_script](https://github.com/zechris/asciinema-rec_script/issues) - command-line recorder of scripts (augmented with meta-programming)

## Reporting bugs

Open an issue in Github issue tracker.
Tell us what's the problem and include steps to reproduce it (reliably).
Including your OS/browser/terminal name and version in the report would be great.

## Submitting patches with bug fixes

If you found a bug and made a patch for it:

* make sure all tests pass
* send us a pull request, including a description of the fix (referencing an existing issue if there's one)

## Requesting new features

We welcome all ideas.
If you believe most asciinema users would benefit from implementing your idea then feel free to open a Github issue.
However, as this is an open-source project maintained by a small team of volunteers we simply can't implement all of them due to limited resources. Please keep that in mind.
